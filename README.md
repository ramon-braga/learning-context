# Creating Posts With React

This project is a basic application for creating blog posts, developed with React using contexts, reducer, hooks, and effects. It offers users the ability to create and delete posts, as well as display the updated post count. The app is written in TypeScript, ensuring more secure and maintainable code.

## Main Features:

- **Context**: Manages the global state of the application and distributes relevant information to all components.
- **Reducer**: Controls changes in the application's state, maintaining a consistent and predictable approach.
- **Hooks and Effects**: Allow interaction with the lifecycle of components and the execution of asynchronous operations, such as saving and loading data.
- **LocalStorage**: Stores posts locally in the user's browser, ensuring that posts persist between sessions.

## Minimalistic Design:

The app's design is intentionally simple, aiming to facilitate experimentation and learning of the mentioned concepts. This project is a solid foundation for enhancing your front-end development skills with React.

## Technologies Used:

- React
- TypeScript
- LocalStorage
